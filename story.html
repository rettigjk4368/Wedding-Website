            <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Jordan Rettig and Ryan Albrecht grew up in south central Minnesota in two small, neighboring communities. Attending the same local school, they grew up knowing of each other, but never really knowing each other. As time went on, they became closer friends and eventually began dating in early 2017. They enjoyed many of the same activities, took part in the same organizations, and even were in some of the same classes. Through high school their love and support for each other grew.</p>
                <p>After graduating high school, the two stayed together even through the large distance of separation. Ryan attended school in South Dakota at SDSU and earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering, while Jordan attended school in Wisconsin at UW-Eau Claire, earning her degree in Accounting and Management. Where 20 minutes separated them in high school, now 5 hours of distance were between the pair. Though the distance was far, they still kept one another close through visits, video calls, and summer adventures. Some of their favorite things to do together are fishing, roller blading, hiking, skiing, kayaking, and playing any kind of sport.</p>
                <p>As college neared an end for Jordan, her soon-to-be fianc√© began the final step of their dating years. On a brisk day in November of 2022, he asked for her hand in marriage. As you probably guessed, she happily accepted. Ryan and Jordan now plan to be joined in marriage next fall, forever sealing that bond that grew from two small towns.  </p>
